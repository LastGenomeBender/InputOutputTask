## InputOutputTask

The task given by our instructor asked us to write a project to 

1. Generate random numbers within [0,INPUT);
2. Write them to a file;
3. Read the file;
4. Seperate the even and odd numbers;
5. Write them to new files;
6. Use enums to manage path and file names.

I, admittedly, overengineered this task to showcase that I can apply OOP concepts and consider various edge cases with my custom exceptions. Repo also includes a UML diagram to assist readibility. Please open the diagram in a new tab to be able to zoom in clearly view the concent!
